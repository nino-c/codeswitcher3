to start sunday:
- webpack study
- try yo m-ionic (uses angular 1)
- review scope.$apply(), scope.$digest()


# general mr. code-switcher mythology

## code-switchings
- continue code-switchings table, use only in meta-tags
  - a code-switching in this case is a sentence or two, with the flavor of a zen koan

## characters
glasses the spicy node-flipper
node-flipping group

----------------------------------------
# philosophy
- place more attention on user identity
  - this will make the website easier to understand, as far as 'seeing what it does' or 'what it is' upon initial view and browsing

----------------------------------------
# names and labels
- "app" => ___
- "exhibition" => ___
- "Apps at an Exhibition" => ___


-----------------------------------------
# programming


## app-display
- ordering of instance snapshots
- instantiate

## instance-canvas
- ** add caching of pure-functional (no Math.random) animated apps **
  - save *data* from each *set of calculations*
      => save each frame as SVG (?)
      [will drastically speed up slow apps]
- homogenize frame-rate

## instance page
- cycle
- codemirror lang-mode

## in apps
- maze error
- bivar landscape, not drawing

## general
- unawkwardize ENDPOINT

## layout
- only one panel
- bottom panel (bottom) -> seed editor (float right) [transform]
- add view source button on home page
  - home page becomes identical to instance page


## packages
### packages that have been replaced by other libraries, but still used (to remove after updating code)
- underscore (=>lodash)
- numeric (=>mathjs)
- complex (=>mathjs)

--------------------

### new app ideas
## existing app expansion ideas
- balls of string: transform by rotation about y-axis
